# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`catia_diagnose` tool** (79 tools total): reports the exact CATIA
  version/release/service pack, the Python/pywin32 environment, and probes
  which automation APIs the installation resolves (ShapeFactory and
  HybridShapeFactory methods matching exactly what the real tools call,
  SPAWorkbench availability), with guidance notes. Motivated by a V5R20
  field report where Part Design feature creation was intermittently
  unavailable (root cause later identified: stale pywin32 cache).
- Compatibility notes section in the README (V5R20 and V5-6 2020 field
  reports).

### Added (continued)
- **`catia_list_faces` tool** (80 tools total) and canonical indexed names
  (`Edge.N` / `Face.N`) from `catia_list_edges`, feeding the new topology
  path of `catia_measure_distance`.

### Fixed
- **`catia_measure_distance` can now target faces and edges**: topology
  resolves via the final shape's HSO enumeration and the selection's
  Reference property (`CreateReferenceFromObject` rejects HSO topology
  cells, field-verified E_INVALIDARG). Awaiting live field confirmation.
- **`catia_sketch_constraint` never worked**: it passed raw geometry elements
  where the API requires Reference objects (DISP_E_TYPEMISMATCH on every
  call), and most CatConstraintType enum codes were wrong (only tangent was
  correct). Both fixed; constraint names are now returned for verification.
  Root-caused and validated on live CATIA by a V5R20 field test campaign.
- **`catia_sketch_arc` called a method that does not exist**: Factory2D has
  no CreateArc in any V5 release. Arcs are now created as open circles via
  CreateCircle with start/end parameters (field-validated fix).
- **`catia_pocket` could report success while removing no material**: the cut
  side was never established. Orientation is now set explicitly, the body
  volume is measured before/after, the direction is flipped automatically
  when nothing was removed, and the result message states the measured
  effect (or FEATURE_NO_EFFECT honestly). Field-validated: 10x10x5 pocket
  removes exactly 500 mm3.
- **`catia_close_sketch` lost track of open sketches across server
  restarts**: it now re-adopts the document's in-work sketch instead of
  failing while CATIA visibly holds a sketch open.
- `catia_measure_distance` documents its real element contract (tree-named
  features/sketches only; faces and edges not yet addressable).
- Missing COM APIs now return a clear `UNSUPPORTED_CAPABILITY` message
  naming the likely causes instead of a raw AttributeError. Field testing
  on V5R20 identified a stale pywin32 `gen_py` cache as the most common
  cause (methods that exist stop resolving); the error message, the
  diagnostics notes and a new Troubleshooting entry now point to clearing
  it first. V5R20 is confirmed running the full core workflow (part,
  sketch, pad) once the cache is cleared.
- Measurement tools obtain SPAWorkbench from the active document first:
  `GetWorkbench` is a Document method in the V5 automation model, not an
  Application method.

## [0.2.1] — 2026-10-02

### Fixed
- **All measurement tools returned MKS values mislabeled as mm**: CATIA V5's
  SPAWorkbench Measurable API returns meters/m2/m3 regardless of display
  units, so `catia_get_inertia`, `catia_get_bounding_box` and
  `catia_measure_distance` were off by factors of 1 000 to 1 000 000 000
  (volume), and the derived mass was wrong by 1e9. All measurement results
  are now converted to mm-based units at the server boundary; the inertia
  matrix is explicitly labeled `inertia_matrix_kg_m2`. Feature creation
  (pads, sketches, holes) was always genuinely in mm and is unchanged.
  Reported by a user via LinkedIn after real-model testing.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-08-20

### Added
- **Generative Shape Design (GSD) module** — 24 new wireframe/surface tools
  (geometrical sets, 3D points/lines/planes/splines/circles, multi-sections
  surface, sweep, extrude, revolve, fill, blend, offset, join, split, trim,
  symmetry, ThickSurface/CloseSurface), bringing the server to **78 tools**.
  Contributed by @gaoflow in #4, runtime-tested against a live CATIA V5
  instance (30/30 smoke tests).
- GSD smoke test script (`scripts/gsd_smoke_test.py`).
- CI workflow running the offline test suite on Windows (Python 3.10/3.12).

### Fixed
- **All 14 Part Design tools raised `AttributeError`**: `Body` has no
  `ShapeFactory` in the CATIA V5 automation model — now uses
  `part.ShapeFactory`. Reported in #1 by @wuqing8577-netizen, fixed via #4
  (also proposed in #2 by @amirhossein199741).
- `Application.ActiveEditor` does not exist in CATIA V5 — view refresh,
  screenshot, set-view and fit-all now go through `ActiveWindow.ActiveViewer`
  (#4).
- Screenshots: CATIA V5 cannot capture PNG; the format is now chosen from the
  file extension (JPEG/BMP/TIFF) with a JPEG fallback for `.png` paths (#4).
- `pip install -e .` failed: invalid `build-backend` replaced with
  `setuptools.build_meta` (#4, also proposed in #2 and #5).
- Log file is written next to the package instead of the process working
  directory (which is `System32` when launched by Claude Desktop) (#4).
- `catia_new_part` / `catia_new_product` no longer crash when CATIA rejects
  the requested name (read-only `Part.Name` on some versions); the actual
  outcome is reported honestly. Contributed by @ewhenbula-svg in #5.
- **mcp SDK pinned to `<2`**: mcp 2.0.0 removed the low-level
  `Server.list_tools`/`call_tool` decorator API, breaking the server at
  startup on fresh installs.

## [0.1.0] — 2026-02-25

Initial release: 54 tools covering documents, 2D sketching, Part Design,
assembly, measurement, export and view control over CATIA V5 COM automation.
